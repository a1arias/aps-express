		<h2>Get it up & running</h2>
		<p>Node.js and NPM need to be installed on your server/PC. Run "npm install ." on the command line (inside the project) to install the dependencies. Then make sure to configure the MongoDB connection details (/config/db.json) and other app settings (such as port). If you are running MongoDB with the default settings on localhost you won't need to change anything. When you're all set, run "npm start" and enjoy :)</p>
